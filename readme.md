# DataMining Assignment (CMPE 255) 1st OCT 2022

In this assignment we are tasked to draw inferences from datasets using bigquery and later representing those by creaating a dashboard application.

I created a dashboard using dash a library for creating dashboards using python.

The following images are the representation of data.

In this assignment I found the following inferences from a temperature dataset that has daily temerature of every us city.

1. Plotting daily temperatures of california cities vs time & Maximum temperature vs Time
2. Infering and plotting the highest temperatures of counties in california
3. Prediction of temperature in santa clara county using last 5 years data
4. Average of last 5 years Temperature in USA by state (choropleth)
5. Scatter plot for daily temperature in San jose city
